# Greetings

:wave: Hello, happy to see you here.

You can read some <a href="https://alexcastrodev.github.io/flexysearch">Documentation</a>

# Why flexysearch

I tried to find a simple solution for table searcher, including Strings, numbers and dates. Sadly, i did not found a solution for that.

I hope you find this solution good ( i know, its simple yet, but will be better soon ) and enjoy it.

# Quick Start

If you want to use `npm`, you can use this command.

```bash
npm i flexysearch
```

Maybe you want to use `yarn`.

```bash
yarn add flexysearch
```

## How to use

This `package` does not have any dependencies. Therefore, you are free to design what you want.

## imports

Import this module

```javascript
import Flexysearch from 'flexysearch';
```

## Tests

All calls and exceptions are covered by Jest

## How to contribute

### Start

You can check our <a href="https://github.com/AlexcastroDev/flexysearch/issues">Issues</a>, or you can create a new one, and fork this project, finally open a PR to `dev` branch.

I'll be quick to implement and improve this package, and if you open a pull request, i'll help you with a new release as soon as possible.

### Testing

I ask you to implement unit test, as i did.

### Changelog
