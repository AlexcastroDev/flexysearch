# Introduction

:wave: Hello, happy to see you here.


# Why flexysearch

I tried to find a simple solution for table searcher, including Strings, numbers and dates. Sadly, i did not found a solution for that.

I hope you find this solution good ( i know, its simple yet, but will be better soon ) and enjoy it.

## How to contribute

### Start

You can check our <a href="https://github.com/AlexcastroDev/flexysearch/issues">Issues</a>, or you can create a new one, and fork this project, finally open a PR to `dev` branch.

I'll be quick to implement and improve this package, and if you open a pull request, i'll help you with a new release as soon as possible.

### Testing

I ask you to implement unit test, as i did.
