# **How to contribute**

You can check our https://github.com/AlexcastroDev/flexysearch/issues or you can create a new one, and fork this project, finally open a PR to `dev` branch.

I'll be quick to implement and improve this package, and if you open a pull request, i'll help you with a new release as soon as possible.
